Data Lists Module
=================

Overview
--------

A Module that allows users to create custom data lists. These lists can then 
be used in a form control (specified via code by a developer) or within a 
user defined form to be able to define controlled vocabularies managed
in a central location that might be used across several forms. 


Requirements
--------

SilverStripe 2.4

For SilverStripe 3, see [DynamicLists](https://github.com/sheadawson/silverstripe-dynamiclists)
